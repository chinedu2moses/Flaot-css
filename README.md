# Practicing float in CSS 1
#### Designing a simple html file is pretty easy using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

#### I created a simple html file and label each box with an id and identical color code.

#### Before getting started I had my CSS file linked in my HTML file.

#### I selected Left, Middle, Right, Full and Division with pound key in the CSS file (example #left) and colored them with their right assigned color.

#### The colors helped in seing exactly where all my divs are, and how to get them into the right places.

#### Change the text color in the sections to white.
#### Make the section elements ocupy the third  right side of the page on top of each other by adding width 33 percent to left, right and middle element.

#### I used the property Float to make the section elements to be next to each other.

#### A tricky thing about float is that you should remember to clear them because a float applied to any element in the page will effect every other element after them.
#### Clear the float and put the overflow on auto to make sure that everything is also stills inside their regular container.
#### With padding the background colors were estended.
#### With 20 pixel magin the sections were pushed away with little spacing.
#### Full element get 100 percent with and covered the whole page.
#### Division get 20 pixel
#### Aside 33 percent, 20 pixel and padding 20pixel for spacing then float left for perfect position.
#### On footer, clear the float and pad with 20 pixels.
#### Tons of stuff in css.
